Expert systems are computer programs that simulate the decisionâ€”making process of experts in a particular field.

They are designed to solve complex tasks that require significant knowledge and experience. The main purpose of expert
systems is to provide the user with recommendations or solutions similar to those that a human expert would give.

Expert systems can be used in various fields such as medicine, finance, manufacturing and law, where deep understanding and analysis of data is required.

The main components of expert systems:

The knowledge base. It contains information and rules necessary to solve problems in a specific area.

The output machine. Analyzes input data, applies rules from the knowledge base, and generates conclusions or recommendations.

The user interface. Allows the user to interact with the expert system.

The explanatory component. Helps the user to understand how the expert system came to its conclusions.
